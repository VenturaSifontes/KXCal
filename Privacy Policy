1. Overview This Privacy Policy applies to the Unimodal XCal Permeability Windows Forms application ("Application") provided by Ventura Sifontes ("we," "us," or "our"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.
2. Data Collection and Use Our Application is designed to operate without collecting, storing, or retrieving any personal or non-personal data from its users. We do not use third-party analytics, trackers, or any other mechanism that would capture or process user data. In summary:
•	No Data Collection: The Application does not request, collect, or store any personal information.
•	No Data Retrieval: We do not access or retrieve any data from your device.
•	No Data Usage: There is no data processed by the Application beyond what is necessary for it to operate locally on your machine.
3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies The Application does not use cookies, web beacons, or any similar tracking technologies.
4. Data Storage and Security Since the Application does not collect or store any user data, we have no user data storage or processing systems in place. There is consequently no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access to non-existent user data.
5. Third-Party Services Our Application does not integrate with any third-party services that collect or process personal data. If this policy changes in the future to include such services, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.
6. Children's Privacy Our Application is not designed for or directed toward children under the age of 13. Since no data is collected, parental consent is not applicable. However, if you believe that a child under 13 has inadvertently provided personal information, please contact us at [Insert Contact Email] so we can promptly address your concerns.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted in the application or on our website with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.
